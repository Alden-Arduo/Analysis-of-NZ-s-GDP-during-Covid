# Analysis-of-NZ-s-GDP-during-Covid

Purpose:
I chose this topic as it was very timely and relevant. I want to know if Covid affected the GDP of New Zealand between 2019 - 2020 and what factors contributed to that effect. To keep it consistent, the chosen factors were affected by Covid as well.

GDP (Gross Domestic Product) - the monetary value of all completed products and services produced inside a country over a certain period. GDP is a measure of that country's economic wealth that is used to determine its size and rate of growth.

Summary:
 - Accessing StatNZ API and configuring its columns to return the desired datasets
 - Total filled jobs dataset from StatNZ API
 - Net export dataset from StatNZ API
 - Total number of tourists dataset from webscraping
 - GDP dataset from webscraping
 - Relational Dataset and plots

Skills:
 - R
 - Data analysis
 - Data visualisation
 - APIs
 - Webscraping

Usefulness:
 Business owners would find this project useful. This project tells them to always
 have a plan B as things are shaky during the times of Covid. They should expect
 their business to not always be filled especially during lockdown, or business
 owners specialising in export should expect less exports.
 I would also recommend this project to those who want to put up a tourism
 business. This project would tell them otherwise due to the decreasing
 number of tourists.
 
Next Step:
 Looking at regional effects might produce different results. Additionally, it would be
 interesting to do some predictions for the year 2021.
