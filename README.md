# Analysis-of-NZ-s-GDP-during-Covid

Purpose:
I chose this topic as it was very timely and relevant. I want to know if Covid affected the GDP of New Zealand between 2019 - 2020 and what factors contributed to that effect. To keep it consistent, the chosen factors were affected by Covid as well.

GDP (Gross Domestic Product) - the monetary value of all completed products and services produced inside a country over a certain period. GDP is a measure of that country's economic wealth that is used to determine its size and rate of growth.
